Xun is an globular wind instrument. It is initially made of baked clay or bone, and later of ceramic. 
People in ancient times used this instrument to imitate birds' sound and ensnare them. 
The oldest xun that has been discovered in China up to now was made about six to seven thousands years ago. 
The sound of xun is endowed with emotional human feelings, like as the innocence of remote antiquity times and the pathos of desolation.
